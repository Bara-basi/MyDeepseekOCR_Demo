{"response": "# Cut-off left vagus nerve\n\n---\n\n## 4. To measure the vagus nerve system line\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cutting the vagus nerve start for one test\n\n### Experimental background\n\nTo measure the vagus nerve, tie two wires at both ends, with a distance of about 2cm between the two lines, to obtain the curve diagram of the tie line and the cut line.\n\n### Experimental phenomena\n\nWhen tying the line, the frequency of the rabbit's breathing curve increases and the intensity deepens. After cutting, the respiratory curve's frequency slows down and the intensity deepens.\n\n### Experimental conclusion and analysis\n\n**Conclusion**: Cutting off the vagus nerve can slow down and deepen the breathing of rabbits.\n\n**Analysis**: Pulmonary tension reflex refers to the inhalation inhibition or excitation reflex caused by the expansion or contraction of the lung.
